  *** WARNING ***
  This is one big ugly dirty hack.  Be careful when using this script!
  It might not warn you about overwriting files (among other things).


soundconvert can recode sound formats like OGG, FLAC and MP3 to 128kbps-MP3s
to be easier to handle on small mobile players.  Other output formats can be
selected, too.

soundconvert tries to keep all TAGs intact.  It understands ID3v1,
OGG, FLAC and GBS tags.

You can define your own conversion formats, see soundconvertrc_sample for
details.

"soundconvert.pl -h" gives a list of options.  Output files are named
automatically (e.g. foo.mp3 will become foo.mp3.ogg when converted to OGG),
see the warning above.

Some archives (.zip, .tar) are supported as well (input only).
To ensure full operation, install the appropriate Perl modules and/or
encoders or decoders.  See the source code of soundconvert.pl for what's
available.

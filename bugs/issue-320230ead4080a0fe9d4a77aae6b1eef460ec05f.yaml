title: support Perl 5.10
desc: |-
  BEGIN{} handling seems to have changed.  $have_mp3_info et al. produce "Variable "$have_mp3_info" is not available at /usr/bin/soundconvert.pl line 47."
  possible workaround: our instead of my or real global variables (ugly!)
  check what has changed and react accordingly
